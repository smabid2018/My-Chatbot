# My Chatbot

## Overview

My Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to answer user queries based on PDF documents. The chatbot leverages LangChain, Google Generative AI, and FAISS to provide detailed answers by analyzing the content of uploaded PDF files. Users can also provide their contact information if they request a callback or further assistance.

## Features

- **PDF Processing**: Upload multiple PDF files, and the chatbot will extract and process the text for later querying.
- **Contextual Question Answering**: Ask questions related to the uploaded PDF files, and the chatbot will provide answers based on the content.
- **Contact Information Form**: Users can submit their contact information if they ask the chatbot to call them.
- **Powered by Google Generative AI**: Utilizes Google's Gemini model to generate accurate and detailed responses.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload**: Users can upload multiple PDF files via the sidebar.
2. **Text Extraction and Processing**: The text from the PDF files is extracted and split into manageable chunks for processing.
3. **Vector Store Creation**: A FAISS vector store is created from the text chunks, enabling efficient similarity search when answering questions.
4. **Question Answering**: Users can input questions, and the chatbot will search for relevant context within the processed PDFs to generate an answer.
5. **User Interaction**: If a user asks the chatbot to contact them, a form is presented to collect their name, phone number, and email address.
